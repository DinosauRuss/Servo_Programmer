Graphical program for creating servo routines. Ouput is an arduino sketch.

servo_out allows creation of new routines on a graph.
servo_in allows communicates with an arduino to graph and record analog values sent over Serial.
sample_input_sketch.ino uses 2 potentiometers to simultaneously position servos and record the
routine using servo_in, in real time.

i2c ouptut uses the Adafruit_PWMServoDriver library with PCA9685 PWM expander.
