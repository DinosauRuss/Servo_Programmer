Total routine length among all servos is limited to 360 seconds due to limitations of Arduino memory.

Option to enter Arduino pin # to call/run the function and run the routine for all servos simultaneously.

i2c PCA9686  module uses the AAdafruit_PWMServoDriver library for Arduino.
Servos directly connected to Arduino pins use the standard Servo library.

Output is a functional sketch for Arduino.

Can save and load previous routines.


Individual plot:

Double-click node to directly enter value.

If connecting servos directly to Arduino, enter Pin #. If connecting to PCA9685, enter servo number (0-15)


Settings Dialog:

Plot names must be unique and no more than 10 characters.
Can add or remove time from the beginning or end of the plot.
By default the servo range of motion is 0-179 degrees, these limits can be adjusted.
Can add or delete servos but there must be at least 1 and no more than 8.
