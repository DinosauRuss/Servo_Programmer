Total routine length among all servos is limited to 360 seconds due to limitations of Arduino memory.

Option to enter Arduino pin # to call/run the function and run the routine for all servos simultaneously.

i2c PCA9686  module uses the AAdafruit_PWMServoDriver library for Arduino.
Servos directly connected to Arduino pins use the standard Servo library.

Output is a functional sketch for Arduino.

Can save and load previous routines.



Individual plot:

Double-click node to directly enter value.

If connecting servos directly to Arduino, enter Pin #. If connecting to PCA9685, enter servo number (0-15)
